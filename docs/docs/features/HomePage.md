## Change Log

### [Date: 2025-09-14] - Header Component Refactoring for Shared Navigation

**Purpose:** Refactored header architecture to support unique headers for each main page while maintaining consistent global navigation, addressing the conflict of multiple header components and ensuring correct page-to-page navigation.

**Changes:**
- Removed the `Header` component from `src/app/layout.tsx`. Each page is now responsible for rendering its own header.
- Renamed `src/components/layout/header.tsx` to `src/components/layout/SharedNavigation.tsx`. This component now exclusively contains the core navigation links to all main pages (Home, About, Portfolio, Services, Blog, Contact).
- `src/features/HomePage/components/Header.tsx` will now compose `SharedNavigation` for its external links, while retaining its homepage-specific UI and internal anchor links.
- New feature headers (e.g., for the About page) will also compose `SharedNavigation`.

**Impact:**
- Each main page can have a visually distinct header.
- Consistent navigation to all main pages is ensured across the application.
- Adherence to Component-Driven Development and Single Responsibility Principle is improved.
