## 📌 About

Hi, I’m **John Oluleke-Oke**, a filmmaker-turned-dev who’s obsessed with workflows, creativity, and AI.

By day, I build tools and systems that help creators edit faster, tell better stories, and stay organized. By night (and also most days), I make videos on [YouTube as @jstarfilms](https://youtube.com/@jstarfilms) — where I explore **cinematic editing, storytelling techniques, creative experiments**, and how to actually use AI in your workflow without the fluff.

My projects usually sit somewhere between **film, code, and chaos management**. Whether it’s Notion templates, Resolve tools, or AI-powered automations, I’m always trying to answer one question:

> _“How can I make this easier for someone creative?”_

This GitHub app is one of those answers — built to scratch my own itch and hopefully yours too.

### 👋 Hey, I’m John Oluleke-Oke (@jstarfilms)

I’m a tech‑savvy filmmaker, creative developer, and AI enthusiast on a mission to help creators work smarter—not harder.

- **🎥 On YouTube (@jstarfilms)**, I break down cinematic storytelling, DaVinci Resolve color‑grading, live‑streaming and video‑editing hacks you won’t find elsewhere — bringing **real-world gear tips**, **timelapse sequences**, and **AI‑assisted workflows** to the table ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/%40JStaRFilms/videos?utm_source=chatgpt.com "John Oluleke-Oke - YouTube")).
    
- I believe you don’t need a blockbuster budget to achieve blockbuster results — that’s why I share actionable walkthroughs and downloadable tools (like my node‑tree presets) to help viewers elevate their craft ([youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1yqihuevu0&utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Burden of Books and Bills | Mini doc - YouTube")).
    
- Behind the camera: a curious creative always tinkering — building tools with AI, experimenting in Notion, automating workflows, and organizing chaos into flow.
    
- My YouTube channel reflects that blend — combining storytelling, technical deep dives, and creative experimentations.

- 👉 **YouTube & Social Links** — show your video‑making chops
    
- 🚀 **AI & Workflow Highlights** — mention node presets, automation tools
    
- 💡 **Mission** — helping creators level up with practical, fun tech
