### Phase 4: Minor Improvements Implementation
If the component is generally compliant but has minor issues:
1. **Extract reusable components** (if applicable)
2. **Add proper documentation** (TSDoc comments)
3. **Improve type safety** (better TypeScript usage)
4. **Optimize performance** (minor optimizations)
5. **Enhance accessibility** (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### Phase 5: Documentation Creation
Create comprehensive documentation at `docs/features/[ComponentName].md` including:
1. **Component Overview** - Purpose, goals, and functionality
2. **Architecture** - Structure, data flow, and dependencies
3. **API Reference** - Props, interfaces, and usage examples
4. **Styling Guide** - Design system integration and customization
5. **Performance** - Optimization details and metrics
6. **Accessibility** - Compliance and screen reader support
7. **Integration** - How it works with other components
8. **Usage Examples** - Code samples for different scenarios
9. **Customization** - How to modify content and appearance
10. **Testing** - Strategies and best practices
11. **Maintenance** - Update procedures and troubleshooting
12. **Future Plans** - Enhancement roadmap and extensibility
