## Changes Made

### BlogGrid.tsx
Replaced hardcoded grays with semantic tokens to improve theme adaptability.

**Before:**
```tsx
<h3 className="text-gray-900 font-semibold">Article Title</h3>
<p className="text-gray-500 text-sm">Article excerpt...</p>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<h3 className="text-foreground font-semibold">Article Title</h3>
<p className="text-muted text-sm">Article excerpt...</p>
```

Specific replacements:
- `text-gray-900` → `text-foreground`
- `text-gray-500` → `text-muted`

### BlogHero.tsx
Preserved design intent for the hero section, maintaining visual hierarchy with white text, light grays, and gradient backgrounds. Brand colors were retained as they are part of the design identity.

**No changes made to color classes.**  
Kept: `text-white`, `text-gray-300`, `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-gray-800`, and brand-specific colors.

### FeaturedArticle.tsx
Replaced hardcoded grays with semantic tokens while preserving design intent for dark overlays and visual emphasis.

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-gray-800 text-gray-100">

</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-gray-800 text-gray-100">
  <h2 className="text-foreground">Featured Title</h2>
</div>
```
