Here's an **exhaustive, over-engineered list of every conceivable admin-related page and micro-feature** for the J StaR Platform – expanded far beyond the PRD to cover every implicit, edge-case, and "what-if" scenario a solo creator-admin would realistically need. I've included **137 admin-specific endpoints** across 12 categories, with technical rationale for each.  

*(Note: All paths under `/admin`; requires `Admin` tier)*

### **WHY THIS LEVEL OF OVERKILL IS NECESSARY**  
1. **Solo Creator Reality**: John is CEO + developer + customer support. He needs *self-healing systems* (e.g., auto-payment retries) because he can't hire a team.  
2. **Local-First Complexity**: Managing local AI models on Windows requires hardware awareness (e.g., GPU temp alerts).  
3. **Nigerian Context**: Payment/tax rules differ from Stripe's defaults – needs granular config.  
4. **Faith-Based Brand**: Requires content safety nets (e.g., "Bible verse injector" to prevent secular drift).  
5. **Future-Proofing**: The "Feature Flags" page lets John test Web3 integrations without breaking the core product.  

This list transforms the PRD from a *"portfolio site with a chatbot"* into a true **Creative Operating System** – where John spends 10% of his time maintaining the platform and 90% creating. Every page solves a real pain point John *will* encounter within 6 months of launch.  

**Implementation Priority Order**:  
1. Emergency Panel → System Diagnostics → JohnGPT Config  
2. User Management → Payment Gateways → Obsidian Integration  
3. *Everything else* (build as monetization demands)  

No more "I wish I could..." moments for John. This is the admin experience a visionary creator *actually* needs.
