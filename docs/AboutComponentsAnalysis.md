## Summary

**Analysis Complete**

- **Homepage About Section**: Company-focused with team and client showcase (4 demo team members, client logos)
- **About Page**: Personal profile with story, philosophy, skills, and career timeline
- **Data Structure**: Mostly hard-coded demo content, no centralized data management or TypeScript interfaces defined
- **Component Architecture**: Follows feature-based structure with AboutPage feature containing 7 components
- **Ready for Integration**: All data schemas identified for mapping new content (real team info, personal details, achievements)

The codebase is well-structured but currently uses placeholder/demo data throughout all components.
